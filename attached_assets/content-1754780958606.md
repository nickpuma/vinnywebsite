Transcribed & Recorded

Non-Verbals

**Techniques:**at 15m 12s use of cognitive reframing

was well-timed and effective. To strengthen it

further, briefly check in afterward to assess client

resonance ('How does that reframing sit with you?')

**Active Listening:**at **2m 26s**, you missed a key

emotional cue when the client sighed deeply

while discussing her relationship.

Explore client's cultural context!

FAQ'S SECTION

## Some Common FAQ's

Many of the common questions we receive are covered below. We also provide pre-sales support, so please contact us with questions

What kinds of clients can I work with?

Over 500 clients ranging from children to older adults. You’ll practice everything from school refusal to addiction, couples therapy to caregiver burnout.

How does billing work for institutions?

We offer flexible billing. Some institutions pay directly, others pass the cost to students as a lab fee (a common model). We also support grant-based funding—whether through Title V, HRSA, or department-level budgets. Whatever your setup, we’ll make it work.

How Does SimCare Pricing Compare to Skillsetter?

SimCare AI: $79 per student — unlimited courses, unlimited access. Whether you're using SimCare in a single course or across your entire program, the price stays the same. Students get full access to every AI client, every scenario, and all features—no restrictions, no add-ons.

Skillsetter: $59 per course.
That’s per student, per class. If a student uses Skillsetter across 10 courses, they’re paying $590—and that’s still for static video clips with no live interaction, no diagnostic feedback, and no session continuity.

SimCare is built for program-wide use. One cost, everything included.

Who is SimCare for?

SimCare is designed and built exclusively for training that develops interpersonal, counseling, and diagnostic skills. It supports a wide range of disciplines including psychology, psychiatry, clinical counseling, social work, school counseling, and behavioral health.

The platform is built to scale—whether you're a university, government agency, training organization, or private company. SimCare fits programs of any size and adapts easily to the needs of instructors, supervisors, faculty, and trainers. No technical setup required, just powerful training that works out of the box.

Is SimCare customizable for our program?

Absolutely. We align client cases with your specialty (e.g., CMHC, MFT, school counseling) and can create custom modules or integrate into your LMS.

WHAT YOU STILL WAITING FOR

## Everything you need to train better counselors

Real conversations. Real feedback. Real growth. Let’s build better care, together.
